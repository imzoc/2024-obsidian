# What the hell is this?
Welcome to my 2024 node-based journal. It contains everything I want to remember for my own reference (except for content kept in `private/`, which I maintain a local copy of and keep backed up in a private repo).

You can view the graph \[here: TBD]

# Why did you create a GitHub repository for it? 
* To keep a backup in the cloud
* To share my life with anyone interested--this is my social media :)

# How do I use this?
See [[Using internal links\|Using internal links]]. Play around with graph view.
